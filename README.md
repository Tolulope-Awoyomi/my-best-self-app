# MY BEST SELF APP

## Specification
* This is a single page application (has one index.html file) created using create-react-app.
* It contains 11 components - <App/>, <Home/>, <Header/>, <NavBar/>, <LogIn/>, <Filter/>, <AffirmationList/>, <AffirmationDetail/>, <AffirmationForm/>, <PhysicalActivity/>, and <Explore/>. 
* There are more than 3 client-side routes using React Router.
* Data is accessed from an external API and a generated db.json file using json server.
* GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests are made to the json server.
* A controlled form is used to make the POST request. 


## Deliverables
* As a user, once the app displays, I should see 5 components ('Home', 'Physical Activity', 'Affirmations', 'Explore!', and 'Log In') at the header and 2 buttons (Logout and Dark/Light Mode). 
* As a user, the first page I should see is the 'Log In' page, where I should be able to input my username and password and login.  
* As a user, after I log in, I should be redirected to the 'Home' page. 
* As a user, when I click the 'Physical Activity' component at the header, I should be able to start, pause, and restart the 20 minutes countdown timer.
* As a user, when I click the 'Affirmations' component at the header, I should be able to see a list of affirmations and their categories, and if I so wish, edit or delete. 
* As a user, still in the 'Affirmations' page, I should be able to filter the affirmations by their categories. I should also be able to add a new affirmation and select a category. Also, I should be able to search for an affirmation. 
* As a user, when I click the 'Explore!' component at the header, I should see a 'Click me and keep clicking' button which suggests activities for me to do. I can delete an activity, if I wish to. 
* As a user, after I am done with my session, I should be able to logout, if I wish to.
* As a user, I should be able to switch the color mode of the app when I click the 'Light/Dark Mode'.
